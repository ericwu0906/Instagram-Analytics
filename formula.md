# Manual Formulas for Instagram Growth Analysis

## 1. Engagement Rate (Unweighted)
ER = ((Likes + Comments + Shares + Saves) / Reach) × 100

## 2. Engagement Rate (Weighted for Algorithm)
ER_weighted = ((Likes) + (Comments) + (Shares × 2) + (Saves × 2)) / Reach × 100
- Saves and shares are weighted more heavily to reflect Instagram algorithm preferences.

## 3. Average View Duration Ratio
AVD_ratio = (Average View Duration in seconds / Reel Length in seconds) × 100
Interpretation:
- ≥ 85% → Highly engaging
- 60–84% → Good
- < 60% → Needs improvement

---

## 4. Follower Gain Rate
FollowerGainRate = (Followers Gained from Post / Reach) × 100

---

## 5. Performance Score (0–100 Scale)
Score = (ER_weighted × 0.5) + (AVD_ratio × 0.3) + (FollowerGainRate × 0.2)
- Weighted blend of engagement, watch duration, and follower gain.
- Normalize scores if needed to keep between 0–100.

---

## 6. Best Posting Time
- Group posts by **hour posted**.
- Calculate average ER_weighted for each hour.
- Select hour with highest average.

---

## 7. Best Caption Type
- Tag each caption with a predefined category (niche-specific).
- Calculate average performance score per category.
- Recommend top 1–2 categories.

---

## 8. Best Thumbnail Style
- Detect or manually tag **dominant color** (e.g., Bright, Neutral, Dark).
- Calculate average performance score per style.
- Recommend top performer.
